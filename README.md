# Simulating a NFA 
> With many different programming languages

This was a task from one of my CS courses:
Simulate a NFA with states {1,..,34}, alphabet {a,b} and the transistions in the file *transitions* <br />
We should simulate the 4 words in the file *input* and output the end sates of that word. <br /><br />

The algorithems vary for language to language. I just tried to get the best runtime I can for every language
